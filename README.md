# TrainingDataGenerator
Generates training data for training ML models. This may seem like a useless thing but it can sometimes be useful if you don't feel like finding a ton of data yourself. Plus, because you can customize how data is generated, you can create some nasty datasets to test your algorithms.

## Usage:
- have julia installed or install at https://julialang.org/downloads/
- clone or download this project
- run `TrainingDataGenerator.jl` by typing `julia TrainingDataGenerator.jl` into console within the right directory
- follow instructions to either use a config file or enter parameters manually in the console
- enjoy your dataset!

## Future features:
- [ ] customizable output formats
- [ ] multiple layered data generation algorithm 
- [ ] visual UI
- [ ] allow for randomly generated weights and biases that are used to generate data
